        Mountains and Rivers
        Mountains
        The Rocky Mountains, one of the most famous mountain ranges in the world, go through the eastern part of Idaho. Some of Idaho’s major mountain ranges within the Rockies include the Sawtooth range, the Bitterroot range, and the Clearwater mountains. 

        The Sawtooth Mountains
        The Sawtooth range is located in the central part of the state. The highest peak within the Sawtooths is Thompson Peak, which reaches 10,751 feet high.

        The Bitterroot Mountains
        The Bitterroot range is located to the west, and forms part of the border between Idaho and Montana. There are some peaks in the Bitterroot range that are over 10,000 feet in elevation, including Trapper Peak, which is the highest point in Montana at 10,157 feet tall. 

        The Clearwater Mountains
        In northern Idaho, we find the Clearwater mountains. Located in the lower panhandle of the state of Idaho, the Clearwater mountains reach their highest peak at Stripe Mountain, which is 9,001 feet in elevation.

        Rivers
        The Snake River
        The Snake River is probably the most well-known river in Idaho, as well as the longest. It originates in Wyoming’s Yellowstone State Park and flows west through the Snake River plains in Idaho until it joins with the Columbia River in Washington.

        The Salmon River
        The Salmon River, also known as “the River of No Return,” runs 425 miles through Central Idaho. With its headwaters originating in the Sawtooth National Forest northwest of the city of Stanley, it runs northeast until it bends west near the city of Salmon. It continues west until its confluence with the Snake River near the point where the borders of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington meet.

        The Clearwater River
        The Clearwater River is a major tributary of the Snake River, and flows through the Clearwater mountains in northern Idaho. It originates in the Bitterroot range, then flows westward until it joins the Snake River near Lewiston, Idaho.

      <h3>Flora</h3>
      <p>
        Flora
        Thanks to its large size, the state of Idaho enjoys a variety of different terrains in different regions, which also bring a variety of different plant species. Some species can be found throughout the state, while others are typically only found in one or two regions. 

        Northern Idaho is a rugged region largely made up of forest-trees such as Douglas fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine. We can also find western red cedar, showing the close proximity of the region to the maritime climate of the Pacific Coast.

        Central Idaho, with its numerous streams and canyons, houses in the higher elevations forest-trees such as Grand fir, western larch, and Douglas fir. The lower elevations of the region are home to meadows surrounded by Ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine.

        In the lower elevations of Idaho, we often see brush steppe ecosystems, which include a variety of shrubs, grasses, and wildflowers that are adapted to arid conditions. Some of the species found in these areas include sagebrush, bitterbrush, and rabbitbrush. Along Idaho’s rivers and streams, we often find vegetation such as willows, cottonwoods, and sedges.
