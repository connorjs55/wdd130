    <h2>Connor Searle</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone, I'm Connor, and I'm originally from Arizona but I live in Rigby now.
    <p>I'm working towards a CIT degree and it's been really interesting so far.</p>
    <p>I like playing guitar, camping, and working with my horse.</p>
    <p>I moved up to Idaho for school and married a girl from Menan, and it has been awesome!</p>
    <p>I've never been a computer guy, and it's a long story as to why I'm pursuing a CIT degree, but so far it has been great.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the Church and went on a mission to the Navajo Reservation in the New Mexico Farmington mission, and I absolutely loved it.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to get to know everyone while we learn some web development!</p>
